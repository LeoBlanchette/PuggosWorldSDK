    Rough Draft\r\nInteractability_Text_Line_1 think of a better title maybe \"Is
    Big J poisoning your food?\" or \"Is Big J making their food more addicting?\"\r\nInteractability_Text_Line_2
    \r\nInteractability_Text_Line_3 Everyone knows that Big J chain restruant food
    has been tasting better recently, but did you also notice the same is true for
    the berries around here? - no wait of course they didn't, who picks/eats random
    berries? In this artical we investigate their experimentation on wild animals
    and how they've been adding chemicels to keep you coming back! continue on here
    about the contract + observations + etc\r\nInteractability_Text_Line_4\r\nInteractability_Text_Line_5
    also seems kind of ironic I'm writing this in a Big J fastfood, but wow these
    blueberry pancakes are amazing :)"
