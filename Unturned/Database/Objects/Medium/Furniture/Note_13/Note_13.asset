    has to keep a record of what actually happened, otherwise anything can become
    history. We didn't know of course, it was just a few blips on the radar - could
    easily have been a suprise attack, and we gave them fair warning! Although in
    hindsite I doubt their comms use the same tech as ours. The one we recovered
    went down in New Mexico. The other one's lost, but I doubt there were any survivors.
    None of us expected it to be a flying saucer! The government's trying to play
    it down from the public, and the official account is that we rescued them after
    they crashed into an unidentified object.\r\nInteractability_Text_Line_4 ---\r\nInteractability_Text_Line_5
    It's not my place to reveal any of this, and we can't change the past... The
    way they're handling this rubs me up the wrong way though... I think I'll quitely
    retire, almost at that age anyway. Maybe we'll move someplace nice."
