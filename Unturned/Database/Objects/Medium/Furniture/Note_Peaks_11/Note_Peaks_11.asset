    Coalition Compound Raid Outline

    Interactability_Text_Line_1 ---

    Interactability_Text_Line_2
    Enough is enough. We''re going to launch a three pronged strike into the heart
    of the Coalition presence here kicking them out for good.

    Interactability_Text_Line_4 Team A

    Interactability_Text_Line_5
    Due to dense walker presence in the city they leave their blast doors closed
    so we''re not getting in there. The bridge entrances are a different story, however
    - they''re left open the majority of the time. Your team will drive through both
    entrances simultaneously before they can react and provide covering fire from
    the overpass.

    Interactability_Text_Line_7
    Team B

    Interactability_Text_Line_8 The sewer system is unguarded so your
    team can slip in and attack heavily armed with the element of surprise.

    Interactability_Text_Line_10 Team C

    Interactability_Text_Line_11
    You''ll be posing as survivors taking refuge through the main city entrances.
    You won''t be able to smuggle in many weapons, but when the chaos starts you''ll
    be able to begin the offensive from the inside.'
