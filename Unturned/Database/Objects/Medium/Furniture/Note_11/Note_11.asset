    Interactability_Text_Line_3 The local government is definitely onto
    us, I got evicted yesterday! With them snooping around our lab the boss is making
    plans with HQ to relocate. Right now they''re thinking either Washington or BC,
    but a few of us are getting sent off to other facilities early to work on other
    projects. I''m assigned to "hallucinogenic weapons" codename "berrybush" up in
    the Yukon, should be interesting. Apparently it''s part of some work for Big
    J, and they''ve already begun testing on wildlife.

    Interactability_Text_Line_5 I''m not sure what to do with Spot, he''s
    not suited to a cold climate. If the location replacement seems like a nice family
    I''ll leave him with them.'
