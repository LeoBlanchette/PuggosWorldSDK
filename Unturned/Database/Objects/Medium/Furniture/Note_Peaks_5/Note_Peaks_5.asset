    Interactability_Text_Line_0 It''d
    been a few weeks since my last contact with anyone in town so I took the trip
    in to restock supplies and see Jerry. I didn''t go all the way in ''cause everyone
    was milling around in the streets. Looking through my binocs it was chaos, they
    looked extremely disheveled and I saw a few folks eating a corpse. There were
    multiple crashed cars abandoned on the way there and back. I don''t know what
    to do or try next, but one thing''s for sure: something horrible''s happened.'
