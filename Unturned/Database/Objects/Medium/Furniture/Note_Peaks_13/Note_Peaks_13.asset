    Our most recent shuttle launch has failed, crashing landing into Cologne 3 clicks
    east of here. Your squad is assigned to locking down the area and beginning the
    recovery process. We need to know what went wrong and salvage as much of the
    equipment as possible. Don''t reveal this information to your team, but be cautious:
    it was carrying extremely radioactive material which might cause a much more
    powerful secondary explosion.'
