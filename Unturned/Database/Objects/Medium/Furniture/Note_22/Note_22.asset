    Interactability_Text_Line_2
    Orders have come from the highest level to launch the warhead... at Moscow. They
    say that the city is being stormed by a dangerous virus, and that sacrificing
    it will save our country. I signed up to protect our motherland, not destroy
    it! I''m burning the message and cutting communications in the hopes that cooler
    heads will prevail and seek a cure rather than wiping out those pour souls. Should
    they try to attack and force a launch I''m afraid I''ll have no option but to
    sabotage the missile.'
