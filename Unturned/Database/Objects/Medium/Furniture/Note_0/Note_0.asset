    Interactability_Text_Line_3 My new workstation at the outpost is turning
    out a lot better than I expected. The staff here seem to be warming up to me
    already, and Dr. Stevens even invited me to play chess earlier today! This lot''s
    experiments are a step above the boring DNA splicing down South and for the first
    time in months I am feeling intellectually stimulated. Still, I miss Spot and
    the cold up here is something else, but the move was unavoidable for obvious
    reasons.

    The shipment from HQ came in earlier than expected, more contract work for those
    executives at Big J. This one seems to be part of an even larger project, and
    I get the feeling they are splitting it up between the labs to make it harder
    for us to see the big picture. Not really sure what the consumer application
    is either, but hey, it pays the bills!'
