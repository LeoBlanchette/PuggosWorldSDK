    Interactability_Text_Line_2
    It''s been a flurry of activity the past few days so I haven''t had the chance
    to write an entry - Russia has joined the Coalition, and I''ve been assigned
    to set up a forward operating base. After surveying the coastline we picked a
    relatively accessible oil rig to secure and begin helping survivors. Scouts are
    reporting that a large region North of Moscow is completely irradiated, so we''ll
    have to be careful of the fallout. Reinforcements are already on their way to
    help us take a headquarters on the mainland, and several nuclear submarines in
    the area are rendezvousing with us here.'
