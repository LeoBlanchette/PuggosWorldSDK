    Fascinating... Once we cracked the first several symbols the rest came very easily.
    From what we can tell so far these etchings seem to be a recording of the tribe''s
    history, of particular note is this large faded icon. It''s composed of runes
    representing nighttime, whispers, a harvest and what they describe in the text
    as a "soulcrystal" of immense power activated by some sort of ritual. It was
    so powerful that even the most pure-hearted exposed would gradually be swayed
    to ruthless ambition. After a horrible incident the tribes were forced to unite
    and fracture it, each secretly encasing a piece in stone such that no one person
    should know the location of all the fragments. This tribe buried their part in
    a tomb guarded by their spirit ancestor "Anastasia". I''m interested to see if
    we can find this relic, however I''m sure it was purely of superstitious or traditional
    importance.'
