  nameEnglish: 'Message_0_Page_0 Darren?!<pause> It all makes sense now, being bunkmates
    Harry must''ve caught him smuggling and gotten thrown in with the cargo! As comms
    operator Darren was also in the perfect place to hide transmissions with the
    gang.

    Message_0_Page_1 I''ll strip his rank and have him sent down to the
    brig. On a brighter note <color=epic>Major Len''s</color> squad will be back
    soon, they captured the gang and rescued Harry. If you''d like to meet him he''ll
    probably be recovering in his quarters!

    Message_0_Page_2 As usual you''ve
    done absolutely fantastic work, thank you!'
