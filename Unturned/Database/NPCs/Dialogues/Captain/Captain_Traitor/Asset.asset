    pulls you aside*</i>

    Message_0_Page_1 It''s time you should know:<pause>
    Len''s working for me. After they kidnapped Harry I asked him to go undercover
    and try to infiltrate their gang <pause>- his recent behaviour is all a ruse
    to convince the real traitor he''s on their side.

    Message_0_Page_2 Due
    to his high rank and therefore access to rare supplies they were willing to work
    with him, even if they were suspicious of a trap. So far they haven''t trusted
    him enough to reveal his accomplice on the ship, but thanks to your investigation
    I suspect the mole will let his guard down and contact the smugglers to rescue
    Len.

    Message_0_Page_3 You''ve done a great job so far. If you''re discrete
    you have my permission to work with Len and form a plan to catch the real traitor!'
