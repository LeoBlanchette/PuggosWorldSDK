  nameEnglish: 'Message_0_Page_0 Some comes from farming in the locations we''ve
    cleared, others are rations and what our scavengers recover, and occasionally
    a visitor trades with me. For example Wallace - the pirate on the top deck -
    has been giving me fish.

    you''d like to trade a few supplies!'
