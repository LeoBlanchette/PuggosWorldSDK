# PuggosWorldSDK for Unity 3d
## A Modding Assistant for Unturned 

Documentation: https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/PuggosWorldSDK/wiki

The PuggosWorldSDK aims to help in some of the more laborious tasks of mod-making, such as:

1. Automatic .dat file creation, and simplified mod-related data management.
2. Automatic crafting / blueprint generation. 
3. Simplified mod generation.
4. Extraction of game data from Unturned for convenient localized use.
5. Automation, automation, automation.

See built-in examples.

Because I worked hard on this, and thought it would be useful to modders, I wasted no time in writing detailed documentation! https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/PuggosWorldSDK/wiki

Please check it out. If you would like to contribute, please do. I welcome the help of enthusiastic and skilled modders.

### After creating your mods, you must properly showcase them! 

See this other Unity project I've made just for that purpose: Unity 3d Model Showcase https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/Unity3dModelShowcase
