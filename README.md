# PuggosWorldSDK
## A Modding Assistant for Unturned 

The PuggosWorldSDK aims to help in some of the more laborious work of mod-making, such as:

1. Automatic .dat file creation, and simplified item design.
2. Blueprint / crafting mods. 
3. Simplified mod generation.
4. Extracting game data from Unturned.

See built-in examples.

Because I worked hard on this, and thought it would be useful to modders, I wasted no time in writing detailed documentation! https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/PuggosWorldSDK/wiki

Please check it out. If you would like to contribute, please do. I welcome the help of enthusiastic and skilled modders.
